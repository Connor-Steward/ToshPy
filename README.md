Get Toshiba device warranty infomation from https://support.toshiba.com/warranty in bulk 

I created this script in a hurry to get a lot of info quickly from Toshiba's warranty website. It's not optimized or neat, but it does the job and works as needed. 

To use, follow the below: 

1. Create a txt file in the same folder as toshiba_warranty_scraper.py called "serials.txt"
2. Fill txt file with serial numbers you want info on, with every serial number on a new line
3. Run toshiba_warranty_scraper.py (need to install Requests Python module)
4. Script with create CSV with all the info you need!
